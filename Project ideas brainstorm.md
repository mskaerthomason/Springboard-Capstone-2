### Capstone 2 - project ideas

1. explore spatial aspects of Capital Bikeshare data
- (if not already done during the course of capstone 1)
- can we predict the best new location for a station?

2. Geographical place names (http://geonames.usgs.gov/index.html; http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html)
- explore trends in placenames
- predict location based on input placename

3. time and place of grocery orders (can you predict impulse purchases?) (https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017; https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2; https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b)
- if we assume impulse purchases are a benefit to instacart (or other similar services), can we predict when they occur? 
- If we can predict timing, can we then increase the chances of an impulse purchase with greater visibility (marketing) of most likely-to-be-purchased products?
- are there categories of impulse purchases that can/should be predicted separately?
  - e.g. salty snacks, sweet snacks, sweet frozen foods, baked items...

4. Predict purchase patterns of toys on Amazon (https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/toy-products-on-amazon/data)
- based on previous purchases
- based on reviews of previous purchases
